The _Also Send to Slack Channel Checker_ browser extension strictly does one thing: Puts a checkmark in the "Also send to channel" checkbox in Slack threads. Not one thing else.

This means that:
- It collects no user or usage data.
- Makes no requests to any external site service.
- Does not read or modify any part of any site besides the one checkbox on Slack.

Verification can be done by reading the source code. It is very short and simple.
